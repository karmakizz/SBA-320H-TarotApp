Troubleshooting

Cards not displaying?

Ensure your API key is correctly set in the .env file.

Check if the API service is online.

Card text overflowing?

Adjust the .tarot-card styles in App.css.

Use overflow: auto; in the .card-content to ensure scrollability.

Background image not showing?

Make sure the image path is correct in App.css.

Use background-size: cover; to properly display the image.
